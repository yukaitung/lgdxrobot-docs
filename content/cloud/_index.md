LGDXRobot Cloud is a robot management system for Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), designed with a focus on flexibility and security. It can monitor the status of robots in real-time and manage automated tasks for transportation and logistics. The system is also designed to support easy integration with third-party services and workflows. It integrates seamlessly with the [LGDXRobot2](https://lgdxrobot.bristolgram.uk/lgdxrobot2/) robot, as well as open integrations with any ROS 2-compatible robot with `LGDXRobot Cloud Adapter`.
