The design of LGDXRobot Cloud mainly relies on machine-to-machine communication. Therefore, you need to generate a root certificate and corresponding key pairs. Then, you can install software dependencies and configure the system parameters.

Before you start, make sure you have the following software installed:

* .NET SDK
* Docker
* Git
* OpenSSL
