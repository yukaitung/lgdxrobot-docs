LGDXRobot Cloud relies on email notifications for incidents, but these emails are only sent to a specific group of users. You can opt in to email notifications and test the functionality.

## Step 1: Navigate to The User Settings Page

Expand the **Administration**, select **Users** and click the **View** link for your account.

## Step 2: Enable Email Notifications

Press **Add Role** button, then search for **Email Receipient** and click **Update**.

## Step 3: Test Email Notifications

Create a new task with the same details as your last task. Then expand the **Automation**, select **Tasks** and choose **Running** from the **Select Task Category** dropdown.

You will see the task you just created in the list. **Click** the View link.
