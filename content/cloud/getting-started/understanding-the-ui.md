Although the design of the LGDXRobot Cloud UI is simple, it may be helpful to understand the basic concepts.
### Step 1: Log In

Visit [https://localhost:5103/Login](https://localhost:5103/Login), enter the username and password you created, and press **Log In**.

### Step 2: Navigate to Home Page

After logging in, you will be redirected to the home page, which displays a list of waiting and running tasks, as well as several charts for operational status.

The UI is divided into the following sections to help you navigate between pages:

1. **Sidebar**: Provides access to every page in the system (subject to your permissions). Click a section name (e.g., **Navigation**) to expand it. Press **Home** to return to the home page.
2. **Segmented Control (Home Page Only)**: Switch between different automation system views, including tasks, maps, and robots. Views update in real time, except for charts, which are cached for a few minutes.
3. **Realm Switch**: Press the button to open a dialog where you can select a realm. The button also displays the current realm.
4. **Profile Dropdown**: Press the button to open a menu where you can select Profile (to view and update your profile) or Logout (to sign out).

### Step 3: View LGDXRobot2 Cloud on the Mobile (Optional)

LGDXRobot2 Cloud is also available on mobile, with a slightly different UI:

1. **Sidebar Toggle**: Press the button to show or hide the sidebar.
2. **Profile Dropdown**: Functions the same as the desktop version, and also allows you to switch between realms.

### Step 4: Navegate a Function

Expand the **Navigation** section and select **Realms** from the sidebar list.

Most pages share common functionalities:

1. **Create Button**: Press to create a new entry.
2. **Page Size**: Select how many entries to display per page.
3. **Search**: Enter text to search for entries.
4. **View Link**: Open the details of a specific entry.
5. **Pagination**: Use the bar to move between pages.
