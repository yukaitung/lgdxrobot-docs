The controller board is an STM32-based board designed specifically for the LGDXRobot2. It supports a four-wheeled Mecanum chassis and can be adapted for other configurations.

The source code is available in the **LGDXRobot2 MCU** repository ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/lgdxrobotics/lgdxrobot2-mcu) | [GitHub](https://github.com/yukaitung/lgdxrobot2-mcu)).

In addition, the controller board has an open-source PCB design, which is available in the **LGDXRobot2 Design** repository ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/lgdxrobotics/lgdxrobot2-design) | [GitHub](https://github.com/yukaitung/lgdxrobot2-design)). The design files are located in the `Board` folder and require **KiCad** to be installed.
