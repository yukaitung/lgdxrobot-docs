The controller board is an STM32-based board designed specifically for the LGDXRobot2 platform. It supports a four-wheeled Mecanum chassis and can be adapted to other configurations. The source code is available in the [lgdxrobot2-mcu](https://gitlab.com/yukaitung/lgdxrobot2-mcu) repository.

In addition, the controller board has an open-source PCB design, which is available in the [lgdxrobot2-design](https://gitlab.com/yukaitung/lgdxrobot2-design) repository. The design files are located in the `Board` folder and require KiCad to be installed.
