After entering the web interface, a terminal will open. All workspaces are sourced automatically, so any command can be run directly in this terminal.

If the terminal window is not visible, right-click to open a menu. From this menu, the terminal can be selected, and ROS GUI tools and ChassisTuner can also be launched.

If a command is too long, press the blue button on the middle-left to expand the Clipboard section. The command can then be pasted into the text box, and right-clicking in the terminal will paste it.
