After entering the web interface, a terminal will open. All workspaces are sourced automatically, so any command can be run directly in this terminal.

If the terminal window is not visible, right-click to open a menu. From this menu, the terminal can be selected, and ROS GUI tools and ChassisTuner can also be launched.

To copy a command into the terminal, press the blue button on the middle-left and expand the **Clipboard** section. Paste the command into the text box. It will be copied to the clipboard automatically. Then right-click in the terminal and select **Paste**.
