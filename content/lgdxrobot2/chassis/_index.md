This section introduces the chassis design, the materials required, and the assembly instructions. LGDXRobot2 now includes the chassis design files in the [lgdxrobot2-design](https://gitlab.com/yukaitung/lgdxrobot2-design) repository. These files require **FreeCAD** to be installed.

The design files are located in the root of the `Chassis` folder, along with an assembly example file named `assembly.FCStd`. Some additional component files are included for reference purposes only and are not part of the final build. The files for manufacturing are located in the `Chassis/Exports` folder.
