This section introduces the chassis design, the required materials, and the assembly instructions. The LGDXRobot2 project now includes the complete chassis design files.

The full set of design files is available in the **LGDXRobot2 Design** repository ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/yukaitung/lgdxrobot2-design) | [GitHub](https://github.com/yukaitung/lgdxrobot2-design)) and can be opened using **FreeCAD**.

The design files are located in the root of the `Chassis` folder, which also contains an example assembly file named `assembly.FCStd`. Additional component files are included for reference only and are not part of the final build. Manufacturing files are located in the `Chassis/Exports` folder.
