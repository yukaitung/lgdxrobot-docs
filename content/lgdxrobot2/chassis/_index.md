This section introduces the the required materials, and the assembly instructions. The full set of design files is available in the **LGDXRobot2 Design** repository ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/lgdxrobotics/lgdxrobot2-design) | [GitHub](https://github.com/yukaitung/lgdxrobot2-design)) and can be opened using **FreeCAD**.

The design files are located in the root of the `Chassis` folder, which also contains an example assembly file named `assembly.FCStd`. Additional component files are included for reference only and are not part of the final build. Manufacturing files are located in the `Chassis/Exports` folder.
