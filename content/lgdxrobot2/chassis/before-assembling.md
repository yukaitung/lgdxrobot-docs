## Controller Board 

solder the header strip to the controller board (Except for the relay module), then solder the Green LED on D1 and the Red LED on D2. Then solder 220 Ω resistor to R1 and 4.7 kΩ resistor for both R2 and R3. Solider the PH2.0 connector to the board, the key facing to the letters. And solder the XT30 connector to the board.

Then install the modules to the board. When installing the TB6612FNG modules, make sure the capacitor is facing the right side (Both GND are facing to the left side), and the USB connector for BackPill is facing the left side.

Please ensure that the TB6612FNG modules are installed correctly, it will explode if installed incorrectly.

If your relay model is not using the header strip, solder the wire and connect to the relay module. Top pin is 5V, middle pin is GND, and bottom pin is the signal pin.

## Power Supply

Soliders the 18650 Battery case to make the battery connection serially. Both Connect the next battery or adject to other batteries are acceptable. If you are using 18650 Battery Protection Board, solder the wires to the to the case as the picture.
