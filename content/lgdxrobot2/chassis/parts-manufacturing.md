Parts are designed by LGDXRobotics and require manufacturing. The files can be found in the [lgdxrobot2-design](https://gitlab.com/yukaitung/lgdxrobot2-design) repository. And the files are not requir any software installed.

## Chassis

The platess are manufactured by laser cutting Acrylic Plate. The DXF files are located in the `Chassis/Outputs` folder. Send the files to the laser cutting service and choose the 4mm thinckness for the plates.

## Controller Board

The controller board can be manufactured by any PCB manufacturer. The Gerber files are located in the `Board/Outputs` folder. Zip the files and send them to the manufacturer. Ensure the board is 2 layers and leave other options as default. You can select any colour for the PCB.

It is possible to DIY the controller board by soldering with the wires on a board, but it is not recommended as it is difficult to debug.
