LGDXRobot2 is a Mecanum wheel chassis with four wheels. The chassis measures 240 mm in width and length, with a height of 134 mm (depending on the wheels and without LiDAR). It is designed to maximise the use of available space and features a three-layer chassis structure. This page provides details of each layer, from bottom to top.

## Bottom Plate

The bottom plate supports the motors and wheels and provides mounting positions for the controller board, power supply, and battery. It also includes an optional mounting point for a camera.

## PC Plate

The PC plate is a flat panel with mounting holes for various devices, including the NUC (formerly Intel NUC), Raspberry Pi, and Nvidia Jetson Nano. Devices can be mounted in two orientations, facing either the front or the rear of the chassis. It sits above the controller board.
